# Chili's Website React Conversion

This project is a React version of the Chili's restaurant website. We've taken the original HTML design and turned it into a more modern, component-based structure using React.

## What We Did

We broke down the original website into these main parts:

- Navbar 
- Hero 
- Cards 
- Banner 
- Footer 

## Technologies We Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel
